    You have said you can only load scripts from your own site (self). You have then tried to load a script from another site (www.google.com) and, because you've restricted this, you can't. That's the whole point of Content Security Policy (CSP).

    You can change your first line to:

    <link rel="icon" href="<%= BASE_URL %>favicon.ico">
    <title><%= htmlWebpackPlugin.options.title %></title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/style.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <noscript>
      <strong>We're sorry but <%= htmlWebpackPlugin.options.title %> doesn't work properly without JavaScript enabled. Please enable it to continue.</strong>
    </noscript>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <!-- built files will be auto injected -->
  </body>
</html>
